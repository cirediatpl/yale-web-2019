# Many to Many Relationships

## Let's start here
We are recreating Twitter. We want to have it so there are users and each of them
can add new tweets! Before writing our code, let's think about their relationship.
That will help us make decisions on how it will be structured!


User ------< Tweet


New Model: Like

User ----< Like >----- Tweet


* Create a User class. The class should have these methods:
  * `#initialize` which takes a username and have
  * a reader method for the username
  * `#tweets` that returns an array of Tweet instances
  * `#post_tweet` that takse a message, creates a new tweet, and adds it to the user's tweet collection
* Create a Tweet class. The class should have these methods:
  * `Tweet#message` that returns a string
  * `Tweet#user` that returns an instance of the user class
  * `Tweet.all` that returns all the Tweets created.
  * `Tweet#username` that returns the username of the tweet's user










## Objectives
Let's describe this specific relationship between users and tweets as a many to many relationship. Meaning that a user can like many tweets and a tweet can be liked by many users!

> **Note:** This is a separate relationship from the one to many that we built before. That relationship could be called "posted tweets" whereas this relationship should be called "liked tweets"

## Deliverables

* User class
  * `#like_tweet` that accepts as a tweet instance as a parameter
  * `#liked_tweets` that returns a collection of all the tweets this user has liked
* Tweet class
  * `#likers` that returns a collection of all the Users who have liked this tweet
